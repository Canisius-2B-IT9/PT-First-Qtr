<p align="center" style="font-family:verdana"> <img src="sakadab.jpg" border=5 alt="SAKADAB-GK Village"><br>
<br>
Problems that occur in this type of community are financial troubles. In the community, they are short on basic human<br>
needs and other resources. Some citizens living there might not be prioritized and supported since there are limited<br>
necessities/supplies. According to the SAKADAB community profile, they have especially been hit hard by the pandemic.<br>
Ever since the pandemic hit, they have struggled with finding a stable source of income to fill the needs of the people<br>
residing in the institution grounds. The financial troubles that the community faces also directly affects the presence<br>
of medical supplies in the area, thus making the risk of a medical problem more likely.</p>

<br>
Another problem that is evident until now, is disability discrimination. Many people with disabilities especially in<br>
this institution, face discrimination, prejudice, and stereotype by the people in the present world. They are not given<br> 
the same equal amount of treatment by the people. Which makes our PWD friends feel that they are not welcome in the society.

<p align="center" style="font-family:verdana"><img src="narm.jpg" height=200 width=350 border=5 alt="Resources for Planting"><br>
<br><br>
After having analyzed the consumptions of our partner institution, the needs that they have that are  unmet  are  mostly  financial<br>
needs. This has been evident in the community needs analysis section of the community profile sheet  wherein  it  states  that  the<br>
institution is having a hard time finding regular and stable income to purchase some of their essential  needs. A lack  of  medical<br>
supplies in the area is also evident based on the needs analysis as a direct result from the financial problems. This makes it hard<br>
for our partner community to keep tabs on the medical conditions of its occupants especially in the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
The resources that our group owns, controls, or can acquire that can be used to meet our partner communityâ€™s<br> 
needs are the appropriate resources needed to start a compost (orange peels, mushrooms and compost pit or tray),<br>
resources needed to plant (soil, water, pot, and ampalaya seeds), and resources such as money, time, and labor.<br>
<br>
<hr color="DarkGoldenRod" width="500"><br>
<p align="center" style="font-family:verdana">
We could put these resources together to meet the unmet needs of our partner community by making a sustainable compost that would<br>
ease the financial situation in their community. The compost would be a mix of orange peel and white mushroom in order to maximize<br>
its effectiveness. The compost can help address the issue of our partner institution by easing the finances they spend on compost and<br>
food as well, while also minimizing food waste in the community. Resources that can be used for planting such as pots, soil, and seeds<br>
can be used once for testing of the compost. Our proposal can be sustainable and not just a temporary one-off that cannot continue once<br>
we say goodbye to our partner institution because it is a sustainable product that can be made simply out of the food wastes that our<br>
partner institution produces. It can also be continued because it takes up very little time and is a lot easier to produce. Plus, it<br> 
can be made in many batches for quicker, more consistent supply.<br><br>

Have you or any of the other members of the organization received unequal or discriminatory treatment because of your handicap?<br><br>
How do you acquire your source of income? Are there any programs implemented in order to help acquire this?<br>
Are there certain individuals supporting you in the beneficiaries and maintaining the operations of the institution?<br>
How will you further maintain the funds in the near future?<br><br>
How many young children/youth are currently under a form of education?<br>
In your opinion, do you think that the youth in the village are receiving proper education?<br> 
Do you think there is a good supply of school materials (eg. pencils, books, notebooks)?<br><br>

<h3 align="center" style="font-family:Sora"><font color="DarkGoldenRod"><b>What important information do you need to know about this community?</b><br><b>Why do you find these important?</b></font></h3>
<p align="center" style="font-family:verdana">
The important information we need to know about this community is that they are a community that helps for and advocates for PWDs<br>
or handicapped persons.  With their restrictions, they have honed their skills and come together to improve the quality of<br>
their living despite the lack of social welfare support for the disabled in the Philippines. In honour of the strength of their<br>
PWD brothers and sisters who maximize their potential, they raised funds to support their ongoing initiative to help the PWDs<br>
across Davao and the Philippines. It is important for us to know the cause that their community is fighting for so that we can<br>
play our part and support this cause as well.</p>

<h3 align="center" style="font-family:Sora"><font color="DarkGoldenRod"><b>How do you think your geometry learnings help you in your ET3/PT as a reflective problem-solver?</b></font></h3>
<p align="center" style="font-family:verdana">
Our geometry learnings in math helped us in our ET3/PT as a reflective problem solver by helping us in designing and implementing<br>
our website. Geometry has an important place in designing, which is why we applied our lessons in geometry in order to design our<br>
website. Concepts in geometry such as finding midpoint and distance helped us when trying to observe a clean and symmetric design<br>
in our website.</p>

<h3 align="center" style="font-family:Sora"><font color="DarkGoldenRod"><b>As an Atenean, why is it important to raise awareness in this type of community?</b></font></h3>
<p align="center" style="font-family:verdana">
As an Atenean, it is important to raise awareness to this type of community because communities like our partner institution do<br>
their best to help alleviate the burden that PWDs go through in their regular day-to-day basis. Raising awareness to this type<br>
of community enables them to be heard by more people and potentially grow bigger and help more around the community. Communities<br>
like these also encourage empowerment of the PWDs around Davao. Recognizing such a community and raising awareness can also help<br>
the living situation of the PWDs in the city by helping minimize the discrimination and inequal opportunities that they may have received.</p>
